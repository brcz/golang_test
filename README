Code that takes a chat message string and returns a JSON string containing information about its contents. 
Special content to look for includes:

 1. @mentions - A way to mention a user. Always starts with an '@' and ends when

hitting a non-word character.

2. Emoticons - For this exercise, you only need to consider 'custom' emoticons which

are alphanumeric strings, no longer than 15 characters, contained in parenthesis. You

can assume that anything matching this format is an emoticon.

3. Links - Any URLs contained in the message, along with the page's title.
